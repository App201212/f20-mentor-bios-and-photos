Write about why you are excited about being a TA or tutor and what type of help you hope to offer students as part of the course. Mention other topics that you can offer advice on that contributes to student success in CS e.g. : research, student orgs, internships, projects, improving coding skills etc etc. Mention hobbies and interests outside academics!

Additional comments added by Phill based on some discussion on slack:
* The main audience is the students in your class
* Put yourself inside the mind of one of the students in the class for which you are LA'ing.     Then, write the bio that would help that student to feel like you are someone that would feel comfortable approaching to ask a question.  Something that's friendly, helpful, and interesting.


Save your bio in a `.txt` file, following the naming convention `Bio-XX-F20-FirstName-LastInitial.txt` and upload it to this folder.

For Lead TAs: After the due date of this assignment, collate all the information for your course and publish it on the course website.
