Hello, my name is Ethan! I am a third-year computer engineering major and am super excited to tutor for cs130b! I took this class with Daniel Lokshtanov winter last year and continued to work under him doing algorithms research. I am pumped to share my experiences in algorithm design techniques! Other than algorithms, I am also a huge fan of web design and am acting as project lead in UCSB IEEE to teach website development to club members! Feel free to speak with me about that too! Outside of classes, I take apart random electronics, play Pok√©mon, and record music. Please do not hesitate to reach out to me with any and all questions!
